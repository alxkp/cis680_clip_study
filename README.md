# CLIP Normalized Cut Clustering for Compositional Token construction

materalize full sequence outer product for latents instead of just <eos> <cls> 

cluster them in spectral affinity terms via nystrom normalized cuts with ncut

then use this with the appropriate loss to encourage appropriate sparse generalizable structures in the encoder/decoder.
